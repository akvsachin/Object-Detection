# Object-Detection

#Hello Everyone, this project may be subject to copyright. I don't have any deep knowledge of python programming or DBMS or OOPS concepts. 

You can take the codes from main.py file. And try to use PyCharm IDE as the code may have minimum errors on pycharm. 

The other files coco.names, frozen_inference_graph.pb, ssd_mobilenet_v3_large_coco_2020_01_14.pbtxt files if doesn't work fine, do not worry. You can just google these files and download it easily.

This project would have taken merely 3 to 4 hours to get completed.
